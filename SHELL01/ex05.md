```
nano "\"\?\$*'MaRViN'*\$?\\\""
1) the first outer pair of "" will preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \(special rule for \, check (3)).
2) The first \ will preserve the literal value of " so that it will not form a pair with the first ".
3) \ retains its special meaning only if followed by $, `, ", \, or <newline>, so the second \ will actually reserve its literal value and \ will be printed. 
4) Due to the exception of $, we need to place a \ in front of it.
5) The latter three \\\ is necessary because we need to print a " with \" at the end. If there is only two \\, then the second \ will be printed but the next " will form a pair with the first ", which cause no " be printed.
